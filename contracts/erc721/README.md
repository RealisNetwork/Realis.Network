# Nftoken
ERC721 smart contract written in Ink!, an EDSL using Rust syntax that compiles to WASM, deployed to the Polkadot blockchain.
 
The concept is the Christian heirarchy of angels, which was inspired by their eldritch, surreal composition described in the Bible. The tokens are angels and move up the ranks. Each player will have the ability to make attacks on other tokens. Gaining victories at certain thresholds will allow players access to more functions.

Note: This game does not endorse any religion, it is strictly written for the fascinating concept of an heirarchy in heaven.
